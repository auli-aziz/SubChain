# SubChain

SubChain is a blockchain-based subscription payment platform designed to manage transactions automatically using smart contracts. The main goal of this system is to eliminate dependence on third parties such as banks or payment service providers. By leveraging blockchain technology, all payments are securely recorded, immutable, and verifiable by all parties.
